*This website was built as a challenge project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl)*

### Project Overview
I developed this project using Vue.js and Pinia state management, and utilized Supabase for backend services.

### Challenges Overcome
- This project was my first time developing a light/dark mode, and required careful planning to ensure both modes matched the designs and that colors did not overwrite one another.
- The layout was one of the most challenging aspects of the project, and put to the test everything I know about CSS to match the layouts to the designs.
- The logic and code of the application was surprisingly the easiest aspect of the project, as starting the project, I had a general idea of how to structure the code to achieve what the application required, though there were still a couple challenges I tackled such as updating and storing items in the invoices.
